    	<h2>7 Dog-Friendly Ski Lodges</h2>
    	<p>Skiers love dogs so it makes sense that each year ski resorts and mountain town hotels become more dog friendly. Cindy Hirschfeld, Aspen, Colorado, resident and author of Canine Colorado, a Colorado travel guidebook for dog owners says, “These days, dogs are certainly considered part of the family. And people want to include the whole family in their vacation.''</p>
    	<p>Hirschfeld points out that many mountain towns, like Stowe, Vermont, and Jackson, Wyoming, have very liberal leash enforcement, and that many communities like Aspen have cross-country trails with designated “poop loops,” where dogs are allowed to get a workout alongside their owners.</p>

    	<p>Mount Bachelor and Mount Hood Meadows in Oregon both recently designated off-leash areas adjacent to their parking lots to accommodate owners who can’t stand to leave their pets at home (or are staying in hotels where dogs aren’t allowed to be left unattended). Perhaps the most dog-friendly of all resorts is Snowmass, Colorado, where dogs are allowed access to the entire mountain, even during operational hours, if leashed and accompanied by owners—good news for anyone who wants to earn their turns, and even better news for dogs. Here, Hirschfeld dishes on her favorite dog-friendly ski resorts, plus doles out some pro hacks to make travling with Fido go as smoothly as possible.</p>
