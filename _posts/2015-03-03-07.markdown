## 1. Two businesses you would like to build a site around.

1. Sleeping Moon - Cafe in Winter Park
2. Croissant Gourmet - Bakery and Brunch Cafe

## 2. For each business, write why you are interested in creating a site for this business.

1. Sleeping Moon - It is very interesting cafe because they are not only selling coffee but artworks. In addition, they do performance sometimes. 

2. Croissant Gourmet - It is my favorite local bakery shop. They have a website but it is not well-organized. So, I chose this local company for my project.
