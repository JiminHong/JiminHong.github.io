## Lab 6: SVG

### SVG

In lab, I mostly research on SVG in CSS tricks. Here are steps I have to take for SVG.

1. I have to either download or make SVG. (When I make my own Vector image, I have to export it as SVG.)

2. I add SVG codes in <head>.

3. Add <svg> in html.

4. Add class of it.

5. Size the SVG in css by using class of it.
