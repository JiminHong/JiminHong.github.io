<h2>Clinic: Practice Makes Perfect</h2>

<h3>Take these tips from Mikaela's form:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Shoulders square: Notice that Shiffrin’s left hand hasn’t crossed the center of her body. This keeps her from over-rotating her shoulders, which could cause her outside ski to skid.</li>
	<li>Level the shoulders: Keeping your shoulders as level as possible when your skis are in the fall line keeps you balanced against the forces of a carved turn. </li>
	<li>Bend and straighten: Allow your legs to flex independently at different places during the turn. Bending your inside leg promotes moving your body inside the turn. </li>
	<li>Move inside foot out: Try to get your inside foot out from under your body. Think about aligning your inside ankle directly beneath the knee of your outside leg. </li>
	<li>Stand hard: Stay committed to the outside ski right through the fall line. Notice how Shiffrin’s left ski—especially the front of it—is solidly pressured and bent into an arc. </li>
</ul>


<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
