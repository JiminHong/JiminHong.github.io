## Lab 6: Information Architecture and SEO

### Information Architecture

Navigation should:

*Be easy to learn.

*Be consistent throughout the website.

*Provide feedback, such as the use of breadcrumbs to indicate how to navigate back to where the user started.

*Use the minimum number of clicks to arrive at the next destination.

*Use clear and intuitive labels, based on the user’s perspective and terminology.

*Support user tasks.

*Have each link be distinct from other links.

*Group navigation into logical units.

*Avoid making the user scroll to get to important navigation or submit buttons.

*Not disable the browser’s back button.
